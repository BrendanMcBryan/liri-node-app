## further expansion

I think this program can be expanded in in functionality. With more time, i would start looking for error catching techniques along with expanding on teh randomness of the "do-what-it-says" function. Specifically accessing the random text file in a more elaborate fasion such as providing a random line or even converting to a JSON object itself.
